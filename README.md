# ai-projects
repository with projects i think

well this is my first commitment - so the thing is I started to learn ml half a year ago and i learned insturments like matplotlib, seaborn (i do understand tho that it is the same visualizer - the same with plotly), numpy, scikit-learn and max what i was able to make was basic ai face detector (using external model) on tensorflow in pycharm. but overall my knowledge was lacking and superficial - thats why i burned out and now with new vigor going to continue my ml journey - well this is 11.11.2025 and im going to start to write my kinda diary in github, kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/erjanomarov). yeah kinda that.
